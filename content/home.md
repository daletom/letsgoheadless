What is this site? It's currently in process, but it's essentially a site to look at several options for connecting a headless CMS to a jamstack front-end.  More info to come...

## What is a Headless CMS?

The term **headless** refers to a web architectural idea, where the body is a database and the head is the presentation layer, which can often be a front-end.  Traditionally, a Content Management Solution (CMS) will have a UI to enter content into a database.  You would then choose a website template and potentially purchase plugins from a store. The traditional CMS would then serve the content from the database on the template you chose.  

A headless CMS de-couples the database from the presentation layer. You would be able to serve content from the database using APIs using several different presentation layers.  It can be initially confusing to think of the set up as headless, since the body (database) isnâ€™t actually without a head (the presentation layer).  The database can just use many different presentation layers to serve content in many different forms.  An example of this could be creating content for a website, a mobile app, digital signage, and a tv app.  Since the headless solution supports many different presentation layers, it is a lot easier to take advantage of faster and more secure solutions.  Developers have the freedom to work with the tools they prefer while a content editor can source content in their preferred UI as well.
