title: Prismic to Nuxt Headless Tutorial
description: Welcome to a tutorial using Prismic as a headless CMS with Nuxt.js as a front-end framework.  I will take you through to steps of starting a Nuxt.js app from start to finish.  We will also be creating a new Prismic account as well.  The tutorial will also be utilizing Tailwind CSS as the UI framework, the Nuxt Image module to generate a responsive design with imgix images from Prismic, and deploying with Vercel.
